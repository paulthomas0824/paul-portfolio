            <p>
                I am a full time student at UMHB pursuing a BS in Computer Science planning 
                to graduate in December of 2021. I am currently in 2 clubs, Crunix which is UMHB's comp sci club, 
                and then the UMHB Research team. In Crunix we help try and bring what we learn in the classroom to 
                outside experience by designing software applications using the current knowledge we know now and bring 
                it to the table. The UMHB Research team is a small select of students that go about creating small but 
                advance projects for either UMHB or learning purposes. For example, we are currently working on an A.I. 
                car using Wavelet algorithm and we also designed a Big Data Cluster using VM's and Dell Servers. I am a 
                hardworking and passionate student who doesn't let any obstacle stand in my way. When I was in High School 
                I designed a video game and sold it throughout my High School, I also went to Game Design Camps at Trinity University. 
                I give it my best and some say that can be my weakness because when I work on a project, I dive in and give it all I got.
                I want to work for companies trying to change the world and make this world a better place with the use of Software engineering 
                and computer science.
